## Game Development Overview

I'm presently working on a single-player fantasy adventure game with dynamic story telling; it can draw from a continually expanding pool of community content.&nbsp; Players begin with access to the game's main story and can gain the ability to opt into community content as the first of many account-wide unlocks.

The game will stand upon the Erotic RPG Engine (eRPGe), a RPG creation tool focused on browser interactions and management of erotic game data.&nbsp; Its engine will utilize modern cloud backup and optimized to rapidly read large quantities of content.
